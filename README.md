# EarthQuake_Data_Visualization
To create this project, youâ€™ll be working with a package called Unfolding Maps, which is a library for interactive maps and geovisualizations.

And what we're doing in this visualization is 
1> Depicting each earthquake as either a square or a circle on this map, 
2> Coloring that square or circle on the map based on attributes like magnitude, like depth and like time.
3> How long ago the earthquake happened. 
4>  Encoding every attribute/feature in a key/legend .Styled our own legend as well and what that key tells us.
