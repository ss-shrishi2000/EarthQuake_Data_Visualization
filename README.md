# Seismic_Data_Visualizer
To create this project, I worked with a package called Unfolding Maps, which is a library in Java version 8 for interactive maps and geovisualizations.

And what we're doing in this visualization is 
1. Depicting each earthquake as either a square or a circle on this map, 
2. Coloring that square or circle on the map based on attributes like magnitude, like depth and like time.
3. How long ago the earthquake happened. 
4.  Encoding every attribute/feature in a key/legend .Styled our own legend as well and what that key tells us.

Interactivity Includes Features Like:
1. Event Handlers to respond to graphical user input.
2. When user hovers over a city marker, the map shall display a box with the city’s name, country, and population.  
3. When user hovers over an earthquake marker, the map shall display the title of the earthquake (including its magnitude and region). 
4. Clicking on a marker gives even more information: A click on a city marker will lead to only that city and earthquakes which affect it being displayed on the map.Clicking once again on that marker will bring the rest of the map’s markers back.
5. After clicking on an earthquake marker, only cities potentially affected by that earthquake will be displayed. 

Overall Implementation Of:
1. Classes And Objects.
2. Object-Oriented Programming Principles.
3. Generation of visual maps using Java code and the Unfolding Maps libraries.
4. Creation and manipulation Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)
5. Used the Processing library in programs.
6. Inheritance , Method Overloading , Method Overriding , Polymorphism.
7. Abstract Classes And Interfaces In Java.

Project for the "Object Oriented Programming in Java" course by the University of California, San Diego in collaboration with Duke University.
